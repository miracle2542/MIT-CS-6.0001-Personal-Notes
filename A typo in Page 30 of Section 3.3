Code:
x = 0.2
epsilon = 0.01
step = epsilon ** 2
numGuesses = 0
ans = 0.0
while abs(ans**2 - x) >= epsilon and ans*ans <= x:   
    ans += step
    numGuesses += 1
print('numGuesses = ', numGuesses)
if abs(ans**2 - x )>= epsilon:
    
    print('Failed on square root of', x)
else:
    print(ans,'is close to square root of', x)
    
        
Comment:    
    
"... the program will execute while loop at most x/step times"
"x/step" times is wrong, should be changed to "ans/step" times.

Example: x=0.25, epsilon=0.01, step = 0.01**2 =0.0001

run results:
numGuesses =  4899
0.48989999999996237 is close to square root of 0.25


numGuesses = 4899
x/step = 0.25/0.0001 = 2500 < 4899

ans/step= 0.5/0.0001 = 5000 > 4899 and 5000 is close to 4899,the expression ans/step also makes more sense.
